## How it works

It presses a hotkey (Ctrl + E for Edge) and that hotkey opens a search pop-up. There is generates 4 random letters and types them in witha number behind the 4 letters. The number indicates how much iterations (repeats) are left. Example: hsow18 - The four letters are "h", "s", "o" and "w" and there are 18 iterations left.

It searches between an inteval of about 10 seconds.

## How to use

### 1. Install python

This can be done on the official website [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). I would recommend you install the newest stable version.

### 2. Install the program

You can run this command in the repository of your choice. This will clone the git locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/evolvedoff/edgefarm.git
```

Note: To open the CMD in the respective folder, reach it in the File Explorer and type "cmd" in the PATH field.

Alternatively you can just download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/evolvedoff/edgefarm/releases) and put in in a folder of your choice.

### 3. Run the program

All you need to do now is type the following in the CMD. Make sure you are in the correct folder (should be the one named "edgefarm").

```
python main.py
```

Note: This will execute "main.py" using python. Make sure to be in the correct folder as else you can execute a malicious program.

### 4. Using the program

After a CMD prompt is opened by the program you are to go to the browser window and press "F1" on your keyboard. It will begin searching promptly.

To stop the program hold F1. This should immediatelly open a new tab. Hold it until another tab is opened. When that happens, you are done. The program has stopped. If this method does not work, you can always wait for it (it lasts a total of 300 seconds or 5 minutes) or close the CMD windows, opened by the program.

Also F1 opens the help menu, so it will search in a new tab this way so it doesn't close your other tabs.
