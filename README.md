# edgefarm

This script farms Microsoft Rewards Points by searching in your browser. 

## How it works

It presses a hotkey (Ctrl + E for Edge) and that hotkey opens a search pop-up. There is generates 4 random letters and types them in witha number behind the 4 letters. The number indicates how much iterations (repeats) are left. Example: hsow18 - The four letters are "h", "s", "o" and "w" and there are 18 iterations left.

It searches between an inteval of about 10 seconds.

## How to use

Just open the program with python. It can be done via a code editor (like Visual Studio Code), via terminal (by doing "py [PATH]/main.py) or somehow else. Then it states that you should press F1 to start. Press it and it starts the 30 iterations. It should take about 300 seconds (or about 5 minutes) to fully complete. During that time leave it untouched as you might ruin it.

You can technically stop the program by pressing F1 again (then resume with it too) but it's broken most of the time so don't really get amazed in case it doesn't work.

Also F1 opens the help menu, so it will search in a new tab this way so it doesn't close your other tabs (I know what you have open, don't lie).

## License

It's GPL-3.0 so like do anything that it allows, else I will have to do legal shit. Please don't make me do legal things.
