# EdgeFarm

This script automates Microsoft Rewards searches in your browser.

> **FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

## How It Works

The script triggers a hotkey (Ctrl + E for Edge), which opens a search pop-up. It then generates four random letters followed by a number indicating the remaining iterations (searches). Example: `hsow18` â€” "h", "s", "o", and "w" are the random letters, and 18 searches are left.

Searches are performed approximately every 10 seconds.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Python

Download and install the latest **stable** version of Python from:
- [Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nrwmjp3717k?hl=en-us&gl=US)

### 2. Install the Program

Clone the repository using:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/evolvedoff/edgefarm.git
```
To open CMD in a specific folder, navigate to it in File Explorer and type **"cmd"** in the path bar.

Alternatively, download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/evolvedoff/edgefarm/releases) and extract it to a folder of your choice.

### 3. Install Required Libraries

Open CMD in the project folder and run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you encounter issues with `pip`, update it first:
```sh
python -m ensurepip --default-pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
Or install the required libraries manually:
```sh
pip install pyautogui keyboard wonderwords
```

### 4. Run the Program

Navigate to the project folder in CMD and run:
```sh
python main.py
```
**Ensure you are in the correct folder** before running `main.py` to avoid executing unintended files.

### 5. Using the Program

Once the CMD window opens, switch to your browser and press **F1**. The script will begin searching automatically.

#### Stopping the Program
- Hold **F1** until a new tab opensâ€”this indicates the program has stopped.
- If this does not work, wait for it to finish (it runs for 5 minutes) or close the CMD window manually.

> **Note:** Pausing the script with F1 can be inconsistent. If needed, restart it later.
